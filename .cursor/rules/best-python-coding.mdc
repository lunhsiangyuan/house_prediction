Python Coding Style Guidelines
Follow PEP 8:

Indentation: Use 4 spaces per level. Never mix tabs and spaces.
Line Length: Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters for code and 72 for comments/docstrings.
Blank Lines: Use two blank lines between top-level functions/classes and one blank line between methods inside a class.
Naming Conventions:

Variables & Functions: Use snake_case.
Classes: Use CapWords (also known as CamelCase).
Constants: Use UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES.
Docstrings & Comments:

Write clear, concise docstrings for all public modules, classes, methods, and functions using triple double quotes ("""), as per PEP 257.
Use inline comments sparingly and ensure they explain the “why” rather than the “what.”
Imports:

Place all import statements at the top of the file.
Group imports in this order: Standard library, third-party packages, then local application imports. Separate these groups with a blank line.
Additional Principles:

Embrace the Zen of Python: “Beautiful is better than ugly. Explicit is better than implicit. Simple is better than complex…”
Write code that is readable, maintainable, and consistent across the project.
